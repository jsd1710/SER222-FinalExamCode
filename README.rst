Solve each of these in a separate file. 
Each solution should be entirely within one JAR file. 

I should be able to run tests with

.. code:: bash

	javac <name>.java && java <name>

Your code must be correct, concise, and clear.


:Unique: Write a function to determine if an array of numbers contains any duplicates in O(n) expected time. You may not modify the array. 

:RandArrayUnique: Write a function randArrayUnique(m, low, high) that generates and returns an array of n random integers each between low and high, with no duplicates. You may not sort the array!

:LinkedList: Write a function that builds a singly linked list from the values in an array. Test with random arrays. You may not use java.util.LinkedList. 

:Reverse: Write a recursive function to reverse a linked list.  Test it with random arrays.

:Middle: Write a function to find the middle element in a linked list in O(n) steps. You cannot use java.util.LinkedList.  Test it with a list built from your name and at least one other list. 


:BST: Write a simple BST of integers. Write a function that takes a list of integers, builds a tree, and prints the values in preorder and inorder.   

:LevelOrder: Write a simple BST of integers. Write a function that takes a list of integers, builds a tree, and prints the tree in level order (top to bottom, left to right).  


Bonus Question (5% EC if it is perfect)
---------------------------------------

:DFS: Visit the nodes of a graph in DFS order; when one node is adjacent to several others process them in ascending order based on their vertex labels. Print out the nodes labels (all on the same line) as you visit them. Use a java.util.HashSet to keep track of which vertices have been visited.   Test it with random graphs.
